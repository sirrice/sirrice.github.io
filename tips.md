The PhD admissions process at top CS departments is highly competitive.
I think it is helpful to understand the PhD admissions process from the faculty's perspective,
and what is prioritized.   This is from my perspective of what I see and may not be representative.
It assumes a department where students are admitted by specific faculty rather than to the department as a whole.  

Axioms

* In round numbers, a PhD costs $100K/year over 5 to 6 years, or a total of $500-600K.   
* The faculty member pays for the PhD.
* The number of applicants grows each year, and is orders of magnitude larger than the number of PhD spots.
* Broadly, the goal of research is to make the highest impact on the world by creating new knowledge.
* Every lab has different definitions of what impact means.
* Research involves many skills including:
  * understanding literature
  * identify value
  * formulate problems
  * design, implement, evaluate novel solutions
  * ability [to write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM)

Basic implications:

* The PhD application is a competition.
* The PhD is an investment: maximize research given a fixed cost.
* A faculty member has a shrinking amount of time to read applications
* The purpose of the application is to quickly convince the faculty that you will maximize
  their lab's research impact as compared to other applicants
* Statement of purpose is not about your life story or what you have done.  It is to quickly
  provide evidence that you will be the best at conducting research _in the faculty's lab_.


Some basic tips

* Understand _some_ research project in the lab.   Have something to say about it
*  See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe9dkYfBBHFkJUmqluDocwGuxaZ3y5Zkm">youtube videos</a> of how to approach the application.


Further implications and how they apply to a PhD application is left as an exercise to the reader.
