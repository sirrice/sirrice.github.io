TLDR; 


There are many goals in research, but one is to produce original thought that has longevity.   

Writing is a thinking aid.  

Original thought is hard, fleeting, fragile.   Seed.   Seeds take energy to germinate and grow.
Original research means depth, precision

Generative AI is easy.  It's loud, it's mostly there, it's a bit wrong.

Energy is used to nurture an idea.


Gen AI

* you don't try and reach for the easy producer
* you spend energy fixing wrong things, and have little energy and mental capacity left over for thinking.


If writing is the end goal, then AI is a useful tool to achieve those ends.

If writing is a means to original though, AI is a dangerous tool.  Particularly for new researchers that have yet to distinguish good from bad quality.


Writing is for two things

* proving you can do it: proving you can think and argue
* clearly disseminating knowledge.
