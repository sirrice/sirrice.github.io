* Nov-2023: Excited to present our vision of [Task-based Dataset Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05637.pdf) at [CIDR 2024](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2024/program.html) in January and  [our vision about using documentation to tackle data ambiguity](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=FflKTuIRTD) at the Table Representation Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2023.
* Aug-2023: We will be presenting 4 papers at VLDB!   [Saibot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00432)  brings differential privacy to task-based dataset search platforms, [Joinboost ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00422) trains decision trees, radom forests, and gradient boosted models within DBMSes faster than ML libraries like LightGBM and XGBoost, [Pollock](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3594512.3594518) introduces a benchmark and grammar-based formalization for studying CSV loaders, and [ConnectorX](https://github.com/sfu-db/connector-x) is the fastest way for DataFrame systems to load data from DBMSes.    Excited to see folks in Vancouver!
* Jul-2023: Delighted to recieve a grant from Columbia's Center of AI Technology to study [differentially private dataset search with Rachel Cummings](https://cait.engineering.columbia.edu/news/columbia-center-ai-technology-announces-four-new-faculty-research-awards).
* May-2023: SIGMOD 2023 is next month!  We have exciting work on a Data Interface Grammar, how to detect and avoid logical errors in semantic layers, CPU-GPU acceleration for In-DBMS machine learning, a suite of XTutor visualization libraries for data education, and the OM3 progressively encoded data structure for fast and massive-scale time series visualizations!
* Dec-2022: Zachary recieved the Columbia Data Science Institute's Avanessian PhD fellowship!
* Sep-2022: IEEE VIS 2022 is next month!  Excited to present our work on [generating fully interactive interface from natural language questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08834) at the [nlviz workshop](https://nlvizworkshop2022.com/), our [recommendations for how to write captions for data visualizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01263) at the viscomm workshop, and our [new formalism and interaction design for ad hoc comparisons](https://viewcompositionalgebra.github.io) at the main conference!
* Aug-2022: A nice [Columbia Engineering article about our research to help insure African farmers from droughts and floods](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/news/using-tech-help-african-farmers-collect-payouts).
