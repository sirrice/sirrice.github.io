* July-2025: Columbia data management had a [strong showing at SIGMOD 2025](https://eugenewu.net/general/2025/07/01/sigmod.html) with a test-of-time award, best demo award, best paper award at DEEM, 5 papers, a keynote, a workshop, a tutorial, and a panel!
* Nov-2023: Excited to present our vision of [Task-based Dataset Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05637.pdf) at [CIDR 2024](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2024/program.html) in January and  [our vision about using documentation to tackle data ambiguity](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=FflKTuIRTD) at the Table Representation Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2023.
* Aug-2023: We will be presenting 4 papers at VLDB!   [Saibot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00432)  brings differential privacy to task-based dataset search platforms, [Joinboost ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00422) trains decision trees, radom forests, and gradient boosted models within DBMSes faster than ML libraries like LightGBM and XGBoost, [Pollock](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3594512.3594518) introduces a benchmark and grammar-based formalization for studying CSV loaders, and [ConnectorX](https://github.com/sfu-db/connector-x) is the fastest way for DataFrame systems to load data from DBMSes.    Excited to see folks in Vancouver!
