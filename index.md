* Sep-2022: IEEE VIS 2022 is next month!  Excited to present our work on [generating fully interactive interface from natural language questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08834) at the [nlviz workshop](https://nlvizworkshop2022.com/), our [recommendations for how to write captions for data visualizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01263) at the viscomm workshop, and our [new formalism and interaction design for ad hoc comparisons](https://viewcompositionalgebra.github.io) at the main conference!
* Aug-2022: A nice [Columbia Engineering article about our research to help insure African farmers from droughts and floods](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/news/using-tech-help-african-farmers-collect-payouts).
* Jun-2022: SIGMOD 2022 is this week!  We are presenting 3 full papers, 1 DEEM workshop paper, 2 demos, and student research competition posters!  We summarize this work in our SIGMOD 22 [Blog post](https://medium.com/@ew2493/wublab-sigmod-2022-8977d14a4d56)!
* Mar-2022: **PI2** is the first system that generates fully interactive visualization analysis interfaces from queries.   We are excited to present it at SIGMOD 2022!
* Feb-2022: Excited to have been recommended for tenure at Columbia University!
* Feb-2022: our paper **[View Composition Algebra for Ad hoc Comparisons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07836)**  was accepted to TVCG 2022 and will be presented at VIS later this year.
* Jan-2022: 2 more paper acceptances to SIGMOD 2022: our demo paper **Interactive Interface Generation in Notebooks** extends jupyter to automatically generate interactive analysis interfaces during SQL analysis, and our full paper **Complaint-Driven Training Data Debugging at Interactive Speeds** enables training data debugging by simply identifying errors in analytic results in milliseconds!
* Jan-2022: FLAWLESS VICTORY!  Our [mortal kombat-themed system](./ninjas.html), **[Reptile](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g80rj9y4znhfhjt/reptile-sigmod22-camera.pdf?dl=0)** reformulates data cleaning as a top-down iterative process.  It has been used in Zambia and Ethiopia to clean nation-wide farmer survey data in order to design their national drought insurance policies. Zachary will present it at SIGMOD 2022.
