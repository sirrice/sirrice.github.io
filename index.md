* Mar-2022: **PI2** is the first system that generates fully interactive visualization analysis interfaces from queries.   We are excited to present it at SIGMOD 2022!
* Feb-2022: Excited to have been recommended for tenure at Columbia University!
* Feb-2022: our paper **[View Composition Algebra for Ad hoc Comparisons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07836)**  was accepted to TVCG 2022 and will be presented at VIS later this year.
* Jan-2022: 2 more paper acceptances to SIGMOD 2022: our demo paper **Interactive Interface Generation in Notebooks** extends jupyter to automatically generate interactive analysis interfaces during SQL analysis, and our full paper **Complaint-Driven Training Data Debugging at Interactive Speeds** enables training data debugging by simply identifying errors in analytic results in milliseconds!
* Jan-2022: FLAWLESS VICTORY!  Our [mortal kombat-themed system](./ninjas.html), **[Reptile](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g80rj9y4znhfhjt/reptile-sigmod22-camera.pdf?dl=0)** reformulates data cleaning as a top-down iterative process.  It has been used in Zambia and Ethiopia to clean nation-wide farmer survey data in order to design their national drought insurance policies. Zachary will present it at SIGMOD 2022.
* Jun-2021: Looking forward to giving a keynote at the [SEA DATA](https://sea-data.ml/) workshop at VLDB 2021 this summer!
* Aug-2020: [For Highly Interactive Apps, Prediction Is Not Enough!](https://medium.com/thewulab/for-responsive-interactive-apps-prediction-is-not-enough-3188bc7b53db) is a blog post to introduce our Khameleon paper.   Haneen also recorded a [short YouTube video summarizing our work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiU5xytHMm4).
* Jul-2020: FLAWLESS VICTORY! Khameleon, our rethink of client-server communication for interactive applications will be presented at VLDB 2020!  With Haneen Mohammed, Tracy Wei, and Ravi Netravali. This makes the sixth [mortal kombat-based system](./ninjas.html) that has fallen to science.
* Jun-2020: Haneen participated in, and won, **first place** at the [2020 SIGMOD student research competition](https://sigmod2020.org/sigmod_student_research_competition.shtml) for her work on [Khameleon](http://eugenewu.net/files/sigmodsrc20/Haneen%20Mohammed%20-%20Haneen_Mohammed.pdf)!!
