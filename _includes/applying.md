<h4 style="margin-top:0em; margin-bottom: 0em;">Joining The Lab</h4>   
I'm recruiting at the intersection of database and HCI, or LLM agents and data systems (less to _use_ LLMs, more to develop infrastructure _for_ agents).   Applicants should have taken courses in both areas and/or have experience in both areas.
Strongly suggest PhD (and Postdoc) applicants read [The PhD Application from a Faculty's Perspective](./tips.html).

* **PhDs**: read lab's work, provide evidence you can conduct research in the lab, include "bananas" in the subject line.    
* **Postdocs**: share thoughts on how you can best make use of my expertise, include "satsuma" in the subject line.   
* **Interns + UGrad + Masters**: <a href="https://forms.gle/4TJRZubQ6Ary3zd47">Fill out this form</a>
