<h4 style="margin-top:0em; margin-bottom: 0em;">Joining The Lab</h4>   
I am broadly interested in problems where academic research has a [competitive advantage](https://wp.sigmod.org/?p=3801).  Currently, I'm working on three classes of projects:

* **Intersection of Data managament and HCI**: what is the [boundary between vis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06404) and [data management](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6r1vaia3tzbo1dwp9yqme/mgg-icdt25-submitted.pdf?rlkey=ttbddaqypbrvydzu87mnanmf8&st=m7glvjmw&dl=0), and how can data systems [enable new](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/d2xg8wb4uonijra1tuccp/pvd-sigmod25-submission.pdf?rlkey=lj9g98q8tku0a961maxofe8x2&dl=0) [interface](https://www.dropbox.com/s/io5hpu5rn4tl9m5/smoke-sigmod18demo-cr.pdf?dl=0)  [capabilities](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bhwikxq8932dsg5/dig-hilda23-cr.pdf?dl=0)?
* **Data systems to support LLM Agents**: we are [building a new lab](https://columbia-dap-lab.github.io/) around this.  
* **Task-based Dataset Search**: how can access to millions of existing tables enhance causal, predictive, or decision making tasks?  See [our CIDR24 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05637.pdf)

I strongly suggest PhD (and Postdoc) applicants read [The PhD Application from a Faculty's Perspective]({{"/general/2024/11/28/phdtips.html" | relative_url}})

* **PhDs**: read lab's work, provide evidence you can conduct research in the lab, include "bananas" in the subject line.    
* **Postdocs**: how you can best make use of my expertise?  what's a project we could work on? Include "satsuma" in the subject line.   
* **Interns + UGrad + Masters**: <a href="https://forms.gle/4TJRZubQ6Ary3zd47">Fill out this form</a>
