While data processing systems are faster and larger-scale than ever, the interfaces and tools for end-users to interact and work with data remain lacking.  It is still too difficult to translate a userâ€™s data needs into the appropriate interfaces, too difficult to develop data intensive interfaces that are responsive and scalable, and too difficult for users to understand and interpret the data they see.   

The goal of my research is to drastically simplify how interfaces are designed and created, and expand what interfaces are capable of.

Interactive data interfaces rather than traditional programming will be the primary means to empower the next billion data users, and have the potential to be as ubiquitous as web pages and mobile applications are today.  Already, data interfaces are indispensible in nearly every domain and every part of the data life-cycle, from data collection to cleaning, analysis, and decision making.  However, the number and effectiveness of today's data interfaces are a mere fraction of what's possible.  The major reason is that current tools do not address the unique challenges of designing data interfaces and ensuring that they are scalable and highly responsive.  As a result, even interfaces with basic functionality require huge amounts of resources and expertise to build.  

The Data Visualization Management Systems (DVMS) project seeks to drastically simplify how interfaces are designed and created, and expand what interfaces are capable of.  I combine data management and visualization techniques to develop new algorithmic and systems solutions, and demonstrate their effectiveness through careful evaluation and user studies.
