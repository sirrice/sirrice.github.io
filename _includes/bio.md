Eugene Wu is an associate professor of computer science at Columbia University.
He is broadly interested in technologies that help users play with
their data.  His goal is for users at all technical
levels to effectively and quickly make sense of their information.
He is interested in solutions that ultimately improve the interface between
users and data, and uses techniques borrowed from fields such as data management, 
systems, crowd sourcing, visualization, and HCI.
Eugene Wu received his Ph.D. from  [MIT](http://www.csail.mit.edu),
B.S. from [Cal](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu),
and was a postdoc in the [AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu).

<h4 style="margin-top:2em; margin-bottom: 0em;">Joining The Lab</h4>   
**I'm recruiting at the intersection of database and HCI, or LLM agents and data systems (less to _use_ LLMs, more to develop infrastructure _for_ agents).   Applicants should have taken courses in both areas and/or have experience in both areas.**

* **PhDs**: read the lab's work and provide evidence you can conduct research in the lab.  Include "bananas" in the subject line.    Strongly suggest [reading the tips page](./tips.html).
* **Postdocs**: share thoughts on how you can best make use of my expertise.  Include "satsuma" in the subject line.   [PhD tips mostly apply too](./tips.html).
* **Interns + UGrad + Masters**: <a href="https://forms.gle/4TJRZubQ6Ary3zd47">Fill out this form</a>
