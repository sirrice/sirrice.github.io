Eugene Wu is an associate professor of computer science at Columbia University.
He is broadly interested in technologies that help users play with
their data.  His goal is for users at all technical
levels to effectively and quickly make sense of their information.
He is interested in solutions that ultimately improve the interface between
users and data, and uses techniques borrowed from fields such as data management, 
systems, crowd sourcing, visualization, and HCI.
Eugene Wu received his Ph.D. from  [MIT](http://www.csail.mit.edu),
B.S. from [Cal](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu),
and was a postdoc in the [AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu).

  <b>Joining The Lab</b>   
  <br/><b>I'm looking for a student to work at the intersection of LLM agents and data systems (I don't want to _use_ LLMs as much as develop infrastructure _for_ agents), or database and HCI.   Applicants should have taken courses in both areas and/or have experience in both areas.</b>
  <br/>PhDs: read the lab's work and provide evidence you can conduct research in the lab.   Include "bananas" in the subject line.  See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe9dkYfBBHFkJUmqluDocwGuxaZ3y5Zkm">youtube videos</a> of how to approach the application.
  <br/>Postdocs: share thoughts on how you can best make use of my expertise.  Include "satsuma" in the subject line.
