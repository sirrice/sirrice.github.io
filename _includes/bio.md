Eugene Wu is broadly interested in technologies that help users play with
their data.  His goal is for users at all technical
levels to effectively and quickly make sense of their information.
He is interested in solutions that ultimately improve the interface between
users and data, and uses techniques borrowed from fields such as data management, 
systems, crowd sourcing, visualization, and HCI.
Eugene Wu recieved his Ph.D. from  [MIT](http://www.csail.mit.edu),
B.S. from [Cal](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu),
