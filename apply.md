My goal is to help my students practice and refine their abilities
as researchers, and produce interesting research as a
side-effect (albeit an important one).  

The following lists the abilities that I believe are particularly valuable:

<div class="row skills">
<div class="col-md-3 offset-md-1 stitle">
Critical & <br/>logical thinking
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
An important component of research is the ability to make logical arguments and back those arguments with evidence.  This will be your most important asset.
</div>
</div>

<div class="row skills">
<div class="col-md-3 offset-md-1 stitle">
Technical <br/>knowledge
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
Most computer scientists materialize their ideas through software systems 
and use those systems to gather evidence.  Thus, the ability to quickly and effectively
build the necessary systems will be a necessary component to your success.

<div class="row skills">
<div class="col-md-3 offset-md-1 stitle">
Perseverance
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
Unlike classes, where a few all nighters is sufficient to get by, the Ph.D.
depends on making consistent, long term progress.  There will be many difficult times during
a Ph.D. (e.g., paper rejections, creative blocks, or <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/05/overcoming-imposter-syndrome/">imposter syndrome</a>) 
that you will need the willingness to understand and overcome.

Our goal when doing research is to push the boundaries of what has been explored.  
There is an art to refining and <a href="https://vimeo.com/85040589">following your taste</a>
when picking a specific problem to work on.

To help me identify applicants that will be a good match, it is 
helpful for you to concretely demonstrate your <i>current</i> abilities.  
The easiest way is to describe some past projects
in terms of why they were interesting, your approach, the challenges and solutions.

<a href="http://www.arnab.org">Arnab Nandi</a>
has a particularly 
<a href="http://arnab.org/blog/so-i-suck-24-automating-card-games-using-opencv-and-python">good example</a>
of a write up that is above and beyond what I would expect.

I don't expect applicants to be experts at everything, so it is important to be clear about
your strengths and weaknesses.  For example,  I did not have 
good writing technique when applying to graduate school and acknowledged it clearly
in my application.

Finally, I will strive to work and generate ideas with you as a colleague.  So
describe some cool research problems that you would find awesome to work on!
